		<h2>"A Monumental Ode to Love"</h2>
		One of the most beautiful monuments in the world, Taj Mahal is located on the banks of River Yamuna in Agra. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Constructed entirely out of white marble in the 17th century, Taj Mahal is one of the seven wonders of the world. Every year visitors numbering more than the entire population of Agra pass through the magnificent gates to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking monument.<br>

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Taj Mahal stands for the Crown of Palaces in the Persian language. Covering an area of approximately 42 Acres, the construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1631 and took 17 years before it was completed in 1648! It was constructed using white marble obtained from Makrana in Rajasthan. <br>

Rabindranath Tagore described it as "a teardrop in the cheek of eternity" while Rudyard Kipling said it is "the embodiment of all things pure". The tomb is laid out in a rectangular shape and can be approached through a massive gateway which has an arch and alcoves on either side of it. There are water channels and fountains in the entrance which makes the monument even more spectacular. The reflection of this majestic spectacle in the Yamuna is almost poetic in its perfection!<br>

		Guru ka Tal is a historical Sikh pilgrimage place dedicated to the memory of ninth Guru Sri Guru Tegh Bahudar Ji. Guru ka Taal is near Sikandra in Agra. The Gurudwara was built over the place where the Guru Tegh Bahadur offered voluntary arrest to Aurangazeb, the Mughal Emperor. Several devotees gather every year to pay homage to the great Sikh guru ( who was martyred along with his followers for sake of freedom to practice one's faith) in this Gurudwara.<br>
		This historic structure dates back to the 17th century. Earlier it was a Taal (reservoir) in the area near Sikandra. It was built in 1610 AD to collect and conserve rainwater in Agra during Jehangir reign. The water of the reservoir was used for irrigation purposes during the dry season. The reservoir was ornamented with stone carvings. This is said to be the place where the Guru Tegh Bahadur laid down his arms to offer arrest to Aurangazeb. The Gurudwara called Guru Ka Taal was built in the 1970s due to the contributions and arduous efforts of Sant Baba Sadhu Singhji "Mauni".<br>
		There were twelve towers in the Tal, but only eight towers have survived the test of time and have now been retrieved. This red stone structure bears similarity to many other magnificent structures of the Mughals like the Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri etc.<br><br>

		<h2>"The Pride of Mughal Empire"</h2><br>
		Located at a distance of 40km from Agra, Fatehpur Sikri is a town in Agra district and a famous tourist attraction. A city predominantly made of red sandstone, Fatehpur Sikri was founded in 1571 century by Mughal Emperor Akbar. It is essentially a fortified city built by the king and had been the capital of his Empire for fifteen years. Now a UNESCO world heritage site, it is home to Jodha Bai's Palace, Jama Mosque, Buland Darwaza, and Tomb of Salim Chisti among many other famous monuments<br>

A unique blend of architectural excellence, as well as religious beliefs - sums up Fatehpur Sikri. It was built by Akbar to honour Sheikh Salim Chisti, whose prediction of the birth of a Mughal heir came true while Akbar was visiting the then city of Sikri. In honour of the prophecy, Akbar built this city and Jama Masjid, a stunning mosque which is still in use today. He also undertook the construction of three palaces for each of his favourite wives, one a Hindu, one a Muslim and one a Christian. An Indo-Islamic Masterpiece, Fatehpur Sikri look its resplendent best during sunset.<br><br>

		An architectural masterpiece, The Red Fort of Agra or Agra Fort was built by Emperor Akbar in 1573. It is located on the right bank of the River Yamuna and is made entirely of red sandstone. The historical fort was once the ersthwhile residence of the Mughals until 1638. One of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, it lies 2.5 kilometres from Taj Mahal.<br>

Also known as Lal â€“Qila, Fort Rouge or Qila-i-Akbari, Agra Fort is a symbol of Agra and is so massive that it is often referred to as a walled city. It is the perfect example of Mughal art and architecture, built purely out of red sandstone. Within the premises of Agra Fort lie the most exquisite structures like the Pearl Mosque, Diwan-i I Khas, Diwan-i I Aam, Moti Masjid and Jahangiri Mahal. Some part of the Agra Fort is used by the Indian Army is off-limit to public access. View of Yamuna River and Taj Mahal from the fort's pavilions is mind-stirring.<br><br>

		The final resting place of Mughal Emperor Akbar, Akbar's Tomb is situated in Sikandra, the outskirts of Agra and spreads over an area of 119 acres. An important architectural masterpiece of the Mughal era, it was built between 1605 and 1618. Built entirely out of sandstone and white marble, Emperor Akbar himself oversaw the construction of this tomb until his death. Unlike the other tombs of famous Muslim kings around the world, the Tomb of Akbar faces towards the rising sun instead of Masjid of Mecca.<br>

The main tomb is surrounded by a beautiful garden that was designed by Akbar himself. His wife's (Mariam-uz-Zamani Begam) tomb is also located in Sikandra about a kilometre away from Akbar's Tomb. Following Tartary traditions, that state that one must see-through the construction of one's tomb themselves, Akbar lived through the construction of his tomb and built a beautiful garden around it.<br><br>

		Often referred to as the "Baby Taj Mahal", the tomb of Itimad-ud-daulah is a Mughal mausoleum and often regarded as a copy of the Taj Mahal. This is the first tomb in India made entirely of marble. The tomb was commissioned by Nur Jahan, the wife of Jahangir, for her father Mir Gheyas Beg (later known as Itimad-ud-daulah), who was a minister in the court of Shah Jahan.<br>

The tomb of Itimad-ud-daulah marks the transition from the first phase of the Mughal architecture to the second. This was the first structure to make use of pietra dura and the first to be built on the banks of the Yamuna River. It basically consists of Indo-Islamic architecture, with the use of arched entrances and octagonal shaped towers. If you take a bird's eye of Itimad-ud-daulah Tomb, it looks like a jewel box set in a garden. This magnificent mausoleum, built on the banks of Yamuna, was to inspire the construction of one of the wonders of the world "Taj Mahal" in the later years.<br><br>

Perfectly aligned with the gardens of Taj Mahal, Mehtab Bagh provides a picture-perfect view of the Taj from the fountain at the front of the entrance gate. It is a popular sunset spot among the photography fanatics and nature enthusiasts.<br>

The splendid Mehtab Bagh has four sandstone towers, one each at the corner with a huge octagonal tank right in the centre. It is believed that Shah Jahan especially got the bagh designed for his personal interests so he could come up here and admire the infinite beauty of Taj Mahal. On the moonlit nights, the clear reflection of the wondrous Taj Mahal in the waters of the park is a sight beyond description. Mehtabh Bagh is now a horticulture delight with scores of vibrantly blooming floral plants and medicinal herbs, besides the umpteen fruit trees, which add to the beauty of the park.<br><br>

		Chini ka Rauza is the tomb of Allama Afzal Khan Mullah, the Prime Minister of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Also known as China Tomb, it was built between 1628 and 1639 and has a marvellous fusion of the Indo-Persian style. It is the first monument of its kind to be decorated by glazed tile work, known as chini.<br>

Chini ka Rauza is located 1 km north of Itimad-ud-daulah's Tomb, on the banks of River Yamuna. The tomb is built facing Mecca Masjid. The tiles for the mausoleum are known to have been imported from China which makes the monument even more striking with their colour embellishments and artwork. Although the enamels and inlay work is wearing off due to climatic conditions and absence of renovation, the Chini ka Rauza is a fantastic example of long-gone style and architecture.<br>
The structure's architectural style is unusual because of the exotic architectural style and is unusually plain possessing a sultanate style unproportional dome.

Due to the inclement weather, the various types of enamel colours have worn away from the tiles. In the facades, the builders used earthenware pots to reduce the weight of the concrete filling which was followed in Rome and Egypt.<br><br>

The Sheessh Mahal was the harem dressing room whose walls are inlaid with tiny mirrors. The palace has a hall, called Jodhabai's dressing Room.

In order to keep the interiors of the fort, the walls are intentionally built extra thick.<br>

Do you have any idea why it is called by such a name? Well, the reason behind the same is because of the wide use of mirrors both in its walls and ceilings. In fact, when illuminated, the mirrors would lend a glittering effect to the whole palace.
Sheesh Mahal, gra is one of the fabulously erected mahals of Agra and in fact, the entire country. Sheesh Mahal is acknowledged for being a work of perfection and there is no second thought about that. Sheesh Mahal boasts of two large halls inside the palace of equal size, each measuring 11m by 6.5m.
